  abstract     = {To investigate the relative bioavailability and bioequivalence, in fasting and fed conditions, of repeated doses of two omeprazole enteric-coated formulations in healthy volunteers. Open label, single-centre study consisting of two consecutive randomised, two-way crossover trials (a fasting trial and a fed trial). Each trial consisted of two 7-day treatment periods in which subjects received one daily dose of the test (Ompranyt((R))) or reference (Mopral((R))) formulations. At day 7 and day 14 (fasting trial), products were administered in fasting conditions and blood samples were taken for omeprazole plasma assay over 12 hours. At day 21 and day 28 (fed trial), products were administered after a standard high-calorie and high-fat meal and 12-hour blood samples taken. Omeprazole plasma concentrations were quantified by a validated method using a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC-UV). Twenty-four subjects were enrolled and 23 completed the study. Under fasting conditions, the mean +/- SD maximum omeprazole plasma concentration (C(max)) was 797 +/- 471 mug/L for Ompranyt((R)) and 747 +/- 313 mug/L for Mopral((R)) with a point estimate (PE) of 1.01 and a 90% confidence interval (CI) of 0.88, 1.16. The mean +/- SD area under the plasma concentration curve from administration to last observed concentration (AUC(0-12)) was 1932 +/- 1611 mug . h/L and 1765 +/- 1327 mug . h/L for Ompranyt((R)) and Mopral((R)), respectively (PE = 1.09; 90% CI 0.95, 1.25). In the presence of food, the C(max) was 331 +/- 227 mug/L and 275 +/- 162 mug/L (PE = 1.21; 90% CI 0.92, 1.59) and AUC(0-12) was 1250 +/- 966 mug . h/L and 1087 +/- 861 mug . h/L (PE = 1.16; 90% CI 0.92, 1.47) for Ompranyt((R)) and Mopral((R)), respectively. Bioequivalence of the formulations in the fasting condition was demonstrated both for AUC(0-12) and for C(max) because the 90% CI lay within the acceptance range of 0.80-1.25. In contrast with the fasting condition, there were significant reductions in rate (C(max)) and extent (AUC(0-12)) of systemic exposure when test and reference formulations were administered with food. The food effect was more marked with Mopral((R)) than with Ompranyt((R)), and the bioequivalence criterion was not fulfilled because the 90% CI fell out of the acceptance range of 0.80, 1.25, for both C(max) and AUC(0-12). The two formulations were similarly well tolerated. Bioequivalence of Ompranyt((R)) (test formulation) and Mopral((R)) (reference) formulations was demonstrated after repeated dosing in the fasting condition. Following a high-calorie and high-fat meal, there was a significant reduction in rate and extent of systemic exposure for both products, with Ompranyt((R)) being less affected than Mopral((R)) by the presence of food.},

  abstract     = {This study aimed to investigate the relative bioavailability and bioequivalence of two omeprazole enteric-coated formulations following repeated doses (steady state) in healthy male and female adult volunteers. The study formulation (Ompranyt® 20mg capsules, Bial-Industrial Farmaceutica SA, Spain) was compared with an omeprazole reference formulation (Mopral® 20mg capsules, Laboratório Astra, Spain). 24 participants were randomised using a two-way, crossover design to receive either one capsule/day of Ompranyt® or one capsule/day of Mopral® during two sequential periods of five consecutive days each. The participants were administered the drugs in the fasting state. Omeprazole concentrations in plasma samples were quantified by a validated method using a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC-UV). The validation method is described. The study was conducted at the Human Pharmacology Unit, Department of Research & Development, Laboratorios Bial (S. Mamede do Coronado, Portugal). The arithmetic mean ± SD values of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) were 1474 ± 1417 μg/L·h for Ompranyt® and 1490 ± 1276 μg/L·h for Mopral®. The geometric means ratio (Ompranyt®/Mopral®) was 0.99, with 90% confidence intervals (CI) of 0.97-1.03. The estimated maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 630.1 ± 516.7 μg/L for Ompranyt® and 736.7 ± 443.3 μg/L for Mopral®, with a geometric means ratio (Ompranyt®/Mopral®) of 0.96 (90% CI: 0.94-0.99). Bioequivalence of these two formulations was accepted based on the two one-sided ANOVA for AUC0-∞ as well as for Cmax. In both cases, the 90% CI lies within the acceptance range of 0.80-1.25. Bioequivalence of Ompranyt® and Mopral® was demonstrated after repeated drug administration in fasting conditions, and both products were similarly well tolerated. Therefore, both formulations are expected to be equivalent in a clinical setting.},

  abstract        = {Omeprazole is a specific inhibitor of H+,K(+)-ATPase or 'proton pump' in parietal cells. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in the process of acid secretion; omeprazole blocks acid secretion in response to all stimuli. Single doses produce dose-dependent inhibition with increasing effect over the first few days, reaching a maximum after about 5 days. Doses of omeprazole 20mg daily or greater are able to virtually abolish intragastric acidity in most individuals, although lower doses have a much more variable effect. Omeprazole causes a dose-dependent increase in gastrin levels. Omeprazole must be protected from intragastric acid when given orally, and is therefore administered as encapsulated enteric-coated granules. Absorption can be erratic but is generally rapid, and initially the drug is widely distributed. It is highly protein-bound and extensively metabolised. Its elimination half-life is about 1h but its pharmacological effect lasts much longer, since it is preferentially concentrated in parietal cells where it forms a covalent linkage with H+,K(+)-ATPase, which it irreversibly inhibits. Omeprazole binds to hepatic cytochrome P450 and inhibits oxidative metabolism of some drugs, the most important being phenytoin. Omeprazole has produced short term healing rates superior to the histamine H2-receptor antagonists in duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. It has also been shown to be highly effective in healing ulcers which have failed to respond to H2-receptor antagonists, and has been extremely valuable in treating patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.},

  abstract        = {Omeprazole is the first of a new class of drugs, the acid pump inhibitors, which control gastric acid secretion at the final stage of the acid secretory pathway and thus reduce basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. In patients with duodenal or gastric ulcers, omeprazole as a single 20 mg daily dose provides more rapid and complete healing compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg at nighttime, or cimetidine 800 or 1000 mg/day. Patients poorly responsive to treatment with histamine H2-receptor antagonists respond well to omeprazole--most ulcers healed within 4 to 8 weeks of omeprazole 40 mg/day therapy. Omeprazole 20 or 40 mg/day has been administered as maintenance therapy for peptic ulcer disease for up to 5.5 years with very few ulcer recurrences. In patients with erosive or ulcerative oesophagitis, omeprazole 20 or 40 mg/day produces healing in about 80% of patients after 4 weeks, and is superior to ranitidine with respect to both healing and symptom relief. Healing rates of greater than 80% are achieved after 8 weeks in patients with severe reflux oesophagitis unresponsive to H2-receptor antagonists. Maintenance therapy with a daily 20 mg dose prevents relapse in about 80% of patients over a 12-month period. Omeprazole is considered to be the best pharmacological option for controlling gastric acid secretion in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Daily dosages of 20 to 360 (median 60 to 70 mg successfully reduce basal acid output to target levels (less than 10 mmol/h or less than 5 mmol/h in patients with severe oesophagitis or partial gastrectomy) during treatment for up to 4 years. Omeprazole is well tolerated in short term studies (up to 12 weeks); the reported incidence of serious side effects (about 1%) being similar to that seen in patients treated with an histamine H2-receptor antagonist. The longer term tolerability of omeprazole has been investigated in patients treated for up to 5.5 years. Slight hyperplasia, but no evidence of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell dysplasia or neoplasia or ECL cell carcinoids has been reported. ECL cell carcinoids have been observed in rats after life-long treatment with high doses of omeprazole or ranitidine, or in rats with partial corpectomy; the weight of experimental evidence indicates that this is a result of prolonged hypergastrinaemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract        = {Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a very common disorder of upper gastro-intestinal motility, differing widely in severity and prognosis. Medical therapy of GORD has involved antacids, alginates, prokinetic agents and antisecretory compounds, primarily H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of these compounds is important, to optimise the therapeutic benefit in each patient. GORD patients are often elderly and pharmacokinetics are move variable in this group. Furthermore, they often suffer from other diseases needing medical therapy and may need a combination of drugs to heal reflux oesophagitis and relieve reflux symptoms. The ideal therapy for GORD will have linear pharmacokinetics, a relatively long plasma half-life (t1/2), a duration of action allowing once daily administration, and a stable effect independent of interactions with food, antacids and other drugs. Over-the-counter antacids and alginates are widely used, buy may affect absorption of H2 receptor antagonists like cimetidine and ranitidine. Aluminium-containing antacids may, over time, cause toxicity in patients with renal insufficiency. In the treatment of GORD, cisapride presents important advantages over earlier prokinetic compounds, with a longer plasma t1/2, low penetration of the blood-brain barrier and fewer adverse effects. The group of H2 receptor antagonists is still the most frequently use therapy for GORD. Linear pharmacokinetics make dose adjustments easy and safe. In individual patients, suppression of gastric secretion is related to the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), but there is wide interindividual variation in the effect of the same oral dose. Only with frequent administration and high doses will acid suppression approximate that of proton pump inhibitors. Tolerance, with loss of effect over time, however, is most pronounced in this situation. H2 receptor antagonists seem well suited for on-demand treatment of reflux symptoms, due to the rapid onset of effect and a decrease likelihood of the development of tolerance. Effervescent formulations provide more rapid absorption and almost immediate clinical effect. Cimetidine, however, causes interference with the metabolism of several other drugs in common use. In elderly patients elimination is delayed and in patients with renal insufficiency, dose reductions of all H2 receptor antagonists are recommended. The most effective medical therapy for any severity of GORD, particularly in severe oesophagitis, are the proton pump inhibitors. The substituted benzimidazoles (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole), are prodrugs which once trapped and activated in the acid milieu of the gastric glands potently suppress gastric secretion of acid and pepsin. Their long duration of action, more related to the slow turnover of parietal cell H(+)-K+ ATPase molecules, allows once daily administration in most patients. Interindividual variation in bioavailability sometimes calls for higher doses or twice daily administration. Acid suppression is closely related to the AUC. Omeprazole is prone to interaction with the metabolism of other drugs, some of which may e be clinically important. Lansoprazole seems to have an earlier onset of action than omeprazole, ascribed to higher bioavailability during the first days of treatment. Proton pump inhibitors have a slow onset of action, which makes them unsuited for on-demand therapy. Clinical practice in GORD calls for the use of not one but several substances, according to the severity and symptom pattern of the patient. Pharmacokinetic optimisation in the treatment of GORD is a question of selecting the most suitable substances and administration schemes within each group. Cisapride is superior to other prokinetics in terms of longer plasma t1/2 and less toxicity. Amongst H2 receptor antagonists, the more long-acting compounds, ranitidine and famotidine, will improve acidity control througho},

  abstract     = {To evaluate the bioequivalence of two enteric-coated formulations of omeprazole, Losec® (reference) and Omepradex® (test). It is hypothesised that formulation differences may be accentuated following multiple-dose administration, and that testing after multiple administration may therefore provide a more sensitive assessment of bioequivalence. The study comprised two parts: an in vitro dissolution test and an in vivo bioavailability study. The latter was a randomised, two-way crossover comparative study after a single dose and after multiple doses in healthy volunteers. Forty subjects were randomly allocated to receive either test or reference product, once daily in the morning, and blood samples were taken on days 1 and 5. Standard pharmacokinetic analyses were performed, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the log-transformed variables in a model including terms for treatment, subject and period. Although both products meet the formal requirements specified by the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) for enteric-coated articles, the in vitro dissolution experiments revealed widely differing properties for the two tested products. Less than 10% of the drug content was recovered from the Omepradex® formulation following a pre-exposure to pH 3 or 4, compared with over 90% recovered from the Losec® formulation. These findings were in agreement with the results of the in vivo bioavailability study, which showed that the two products differed in both their rate and extent of absorption after a single dose and following multiple doses. The products failed the bioequivalence test for area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma drug concentration (C ) after a single dose [AUC: test/reference ratio 0.85, 90% confidence interval (0.76-0.95); C : test/reference ratio 0.85, 90% confidence interval (0.75-0.95)], and the difference between the formulations was even more pronounced after multiple doses [AUC: test/reference ratio 0.73, 90% confidence interval (0.65-0.83); Cmax: test/reference ratio 0.71, 90% confidence interval (0.63-0.81)]. These data suggest that bioequivalence studies on enteric-coated proton pump inhibitors should include both single- and multiple-dose elements to be fully decisive. The two omeprazole products failed to show bioequivalence, with the observed differences being even more apparent after multiple doses, as postulated. Based on this study, the two products may not be considered either therapeutically equivalent or interchangeable.},

  abstract        = {The effects of omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, on gastric acid and pepsin secretion have been studied in twelve healthy subjects. From six to eight hours after a single oral dose of 30 mg, there was a 66% reduction in basal acid output, and a 71.2% reduction in pentagastrin stimulated acid output. A single dose of 60 mg produced a 91.7% reduction in basal acid output and a 95.3% reduction in pentagastrin stimulated acid output. After seven days treatment with 30 or 60 mg daily, there was almost 100% inhibition of both basal and pentagastrin stimulated acid output. Omeprazole did not significantly affect pepsin secretion which is in keeping with its proposed mode of action, as an inhibitor of the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme on the secretory membrane of the parietal cell. There were no side effects after omeprazole either with single or repeated dosing.},

  abstract        = {Single doses of omeprazole inhibit pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion and almost complete inhibition can be achieved for 4-6 hours with a single dose of 80 mg. Acid secretion then slowly returns and reaches normal levels after 3-4 days. Omeprazole also dose-dependently inhibits basal acid secretion as well as acid secretion stimulated with histamine, peptone and modified sham feeding, with similar efficiency. During repeated once-daily dosing with an enteric-coated granule capsule formulation, inhibition of acid secretion increased initially, and stabilized within about 4 days. Dose-response studies in patients with duodenal ulcers and healthy subjects have shown that 20-40 mg/day results in a peak reduction (80-100%) of pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion 6 hours after dose. Studies of 24-hour intragastric acidity in duodenal ulcer patients have shown that 4 weeks of treatment with omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, resulted in a reduction of median intragastric acidity by 97%, which was superior to the 57% median reduction achieved with ranitidine, 150 mg b.d., for 4 weeks in the same patients. During omeprazole treatment, fasting plasma gastrin increased in relation to the degree of inhibition of acid secretion. After discontinuation of treatment, plasma gastrin normalized. Treatment with omeprazole, 20 mg, increased 24-hour plasma gastrin to the same extent as after highly selective vagotomy. Long-term treatment with omeprazole, 20-40 mg, for up to 2 years has not been associated with any progressive rise in fasting plasma gastrin.},

Dose-response studies in both DU-patients and healthy subjects have shown that daily doses of 20-40 mg result in 80-100% reduction of stimulated acid secretion when measured 6 h after dose.

The level of increase of 24 h plasma gastrin during once daily treatment with 20 mg omeprazole was slightly higher than for ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily, but similar to that seen after highly selective vagotomy.},

Fasting plasma gastrin concentration and peak acid output in response to a maximal intravenous dose of pentagastrin were measured before, during and after the 14 days of treatment. Omeprazole caused a 68% (mean) decrease in the peak acid output when measured 24 hours after the last dose, with a simultaneous increase in the fasting plasma gastrin concentration. When measured 1, 2, 3 and 8 weeks after cessation of treatment, there was no significant difference in the peak acid output between the two groups. The study demonstrates that there is no increase in the acid production capacity after 2 weeks of treatment with omeprazole. Thus it would appear that the rise in the plasma gastrin concentration during short-term treatment with omeprazole does not induce parietal cell hypertrophy or hyperplasia.},

  abstract     = {Omeprazole blocks the secretion of gastric acid and belongs to the drug class of proton pump inhibitors. It is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, erosive esophagitis, and other acid-related disorders. It is also used in the treatment of hypersecretory conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and is used in combination with antibiotics to eradicate   infection (1). CYP2C19 is the principal enzyme that metabolizes omeprazole to inactive metabolites. Approximately 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians have reduced or absent CYP2C19 enzyme activity (“poor metabolizers”). In these individuals, standard doses of omeprazole may lead to higher exposure to the drug and improved treatment outcomes (2). In contrast, individuals with increased CYP2C19 activity (“ultrarapid metabolizers”) may have an insufficient response to treatment as the active drug is inactivated at a faster rate. The FDA-approved drug label for omeprazole states that a dose reduction should be considered in the Asian population, particularly for the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis (1). The Pharmacogenetics Working Group of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP) has published dose alterations based on   genotype. For   poor metabolizers, they do not recommend altering the dose; however for ultrarapid metabolizers, they recommend being extra alert to an insufficient response to treatment. For the eradication of   in ultrarapid metabolizers, they recommend increasing the dose of omeprazole by 100–200%, and to consider the same dose increase for other conditions (see Table 1) (3, 4).},

  abstract        = {This review examines the literature on drug interactions with omeprazole. Different mechanisms have been proposed as potential causes for such interactions. First, the absorption of some drugs might be altered due to the decreased intragastric acidity resulting from omeprazole treatment. There was no effect of omeprazole on the absorption of amoxycillin, bacampicillin and alcohol, while the amount of digoxin and nifedipine absorbed was increased by 10 and 21%, respectively, both increases probably being of no clinical significance. Secondly, the metabolism of high clearance drugs might be altered by changes in liver blood flow, although that is not affected by omeprazole, as indicated by the unchanged elimination of indocyanine green. In addition, the clearance of intravenously administered lidocaine (lignocaine) [a high clearance drug] was unaffected by omeprazole, further indicating that the latter does not alter liver blood flow. Thirdly, since omeprazole is a substituted benzimidazole, it might have the potential to interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug metabolising enzymes in the cytochrome P450 system, through either induction or inhibition. There is no indication of induction of this enzyme system in any interaction study with omeprazole. As regards inhibition, on the other hand, there is now considerable information available which indicates that omeprazole has the potential to partly inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolised to a great extent by the cytochrome P450 enzyme subfamily IIC (diazepam, phenytoin), but not of those metabolised by subfamilies IA (caffeine, theophylline), IID (metoprolol, propranolol) and IIIA (cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine). Since relatively few drugs are metabolised mainly by IIC compared with IID and IIIA, the potential for omeprazole to interfere with the metabolism of other drugs appears to be limited.},
